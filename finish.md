# Finished ? Congratulations ! ðŸŽ‰

You now know the basics of a Progressive Web App, but you still have a lot to discover!

## Additional exercises

Here are some additional exercises that you can try to achieve from the knowledge gained in this workshop:

- replace images of non-cached attendees with a `fallback.jpg` default image when the network request fails
- add an expiration time to the API GET request cache
- automatically request a background sync 1 minute after the previous one
